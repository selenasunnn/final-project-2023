        <p> Hi! My name is Selena and I'm a second-year student at the University of Michigan pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information with a focus in UX Design. I'm passionate about creating content and designs that make platforms more engaging and accessible, particularly within the sports industry. I started my sports media journey a year ago and have fallen in love with it since!

            I currently serve as the creative media intern for Michigan Women's Basketball and digital strategy intern for Michigan Football. I have previously worked for the Michigan Daily as a Senior Photo Editor and the Capital One Orange Bowl as a Content Creator. I have also created commissioned work for the Chicago Bulls. This summer I will be working for Madison Square Garden Sports as a Motion Design Associate for the New York Knicks and Rangers.
            
            Growing up in Hong Kong, a city characterised by ever-changing cultural dynamics, political turmoil, and misunderstandings, I found myself drawn to photojournalism and telling meaningful stories. That, combined with my love for exploring the great outdoors, has allowed me to go on so many amazing adventures and show people how I view this world through my lens. Since then, I've shifted my focus primarily to fashion, portraiture, and sports photography, but I still love to shoot across all areas as long as there is a story to tell.

            Feel free to reach out with any inquiries! My line is always open!
